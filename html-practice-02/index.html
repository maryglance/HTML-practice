      <h2>What is <em>Binangkal</em>?</h2>
      <p><em>Binangkal</em> is a native doughnut from Mindanao and Visayas, but also commonly found in most homegrown neighborhood bakeries or panaderias in the Philippines. It’s especially popular in Cebu as a snack school kids can bring. Unlike most fried and fluffy donuts, <em>binangkal</em> bread is chewy, making it the perfect pair with sesame seeds. The sesame seed’s nutty flavor is released with every bite and chew of the golden brown hard-crisp crust.</p>
      <p><em>Binangkal</em> gets its name after how these fried spherical donuts are shaped similarly to the fruits of the Nauclea orientalis tree, locally called “bangkal.” The tree’s fruits are also irregularly round, rough textured, and when partially opened, resembled the cracked part of binangkal. </p>

      <h2>How to Serve <em>Binangkal</em></h2>

      <h2>How to Make <em>Binangkal</em></h2>
      <p>This classic, nutty, crispy doughnut recipe uses common ingredients and requires very little effort. First, combine all the dry ingredients in one bowl. Then, in another bowl, combine all the wet ingredients. Combine the two mixtures until it forms a dough. To shape them, use a spoon to scoop a ball and roll it in sesame seeds. With lightly wet fingers, roll the shape and make sure that seeds are embedded into the dough.</p>
      <p>Finish off by deep frying in very hot oil until the binangkal are golden brown. Strain the fried doughnuts and serve hot. Remove excess oil by transferring the doughnuts to a strainer or a plate lined with paper towels.</p>

      <h2>Tips to Make Easy <em>Binangkal</em></h2>
      <h4>1. You can try using a combination of black and white sesame seeds.</h4>
      <p>Black sesame seeds have a stronger, nuttier, almost peppery flavor compared to regular white sesame seeds. Not only will the black sesame add flavor, you’ll also bump up the visual appeal of these doughnuts.</p>
      <h4>2. Be a little adventurous by using almond extract.</h4>
      <p>Almond extract will give your <em>binangkal</em> a <em>financier</em>-like flavor! Simply replace the vanilla extract with almond extract. You can also double the amount of almond extract if you’re especially fond of the flavor.</p>
      <h4>3. Use a toaster to warm up <em>binangkal</em>.</h4>
      <p>Generally, it’s better to warm up bread in a toaster for even dry heat that can also add crispness. Just be careful not to toast it too much or you might burn it!</p>
      <h4>4. Fry your <em>binangkal</em> with just the right heat.</h4>
      <p>Heat up oil to around 300°F (150°C). If your oil isn’t hot enough, your doughnut will absorb too much oil; too hot and the outside will cook too quickly before the inside is done. It’s best to cook one doughnut first to test and adjust as necessary. To maintain oil temperature, don’t overfill your pot: fry only 6–8 doughnuts at a time.</p>
      <h4>5. Choose a neutral-flavored oil.</h4>
      <p>Doughnuts will absorb the flavor of the oil used. This recipe is best fried with a neutral-flavored oil so the nuttiness of the sesame shines through.</p>

      <h2>How to Store <em>Binangkal</em></h2>
      <h4>1. Keep <em>binangkal</em> at room temperature.</h4>
      <p>As with most bakery classics, these breads do well at room temperature when displayed in glass display cases. Expect them to keep for 1–2 days on your table, or stored in an airtight container for a short trip.</p>
      <h4>2. To keep for a week, line your airtight container with tissue napkins.</h4>
      <p>Tissue napkins will help absorb excess oil and help the bread keep longer. The high heat used for binangkal also helps with its shelf life, but note that as binangkal stales it will tend to get harder and tougher to chew.</p>
